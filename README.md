This project highlights my ability to work across the full analytics lifecycle—from defining business problems and preparing data to delivering actionable insights and executive-level recommendations. I am comfortable working with raw datasets using Excel and SQL for data extraction, cleaning, transformation, and validation, before advancing analysis and visualization in Power BI.

In my Customer Behaviour Analysis project, I analyzed an e-commerce dataset to uncover:

Who the most valuable customers are and how revenue is distributed

What differentiates repeat customers from one-time buyers

Which customer segments and product categories drive the most revenue

How engagement translates into monetization across categories

Where opportunities exist to improve retention and growth
