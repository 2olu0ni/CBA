The customer behaviour analysis reveals that business performance is driven primarily by a relatively small group of highly engaged, repeat customers and a few high-performing product categories.

Revenue is highly concentrated, with the top 500 customers contributing approximately 38.8% of total spend, indicating strong customer loyalty but also a dependency risk if these customers are not effectively retained. Returning customers generate significantly more transactions than one-time buyers, confirming that repeat behavior is a key driver of revenue growth.

Customer segmentation shows that young adults—across both genders—are the dominant revenue contributors, accounting for the majority of total spend. This suggests that age is a stronger determinant of customer value than gender, and that the business’s offerings are well-aligned with the preferences of this demographic.

From a product perspective, Electronics clearly outperforms all other categories, acting as the primary revenue engine, while Home & Garden and Sports serve as strong secondary contributors. Other categories demonstrate similar engagement levels but lower revenue, indicating that monetization challenges are driven more by pricing and basket size than by lack of customer interest.
